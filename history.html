                   <p>The history of dance is difficult to access because dance does not often leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts that last over millennia, such as stone tools, 
                       hunting implements or cave paintings. 
                       It is not possible to identify with exact precision.

                    <h5>INDIAN CLASSICAL HISTORY</h5>
                    <p>An early manuscript describing dance is 
                        the Natya Shastra on which is based the 
                        modern interpretation of classical Indian dance
                         (Bharathanatyam).
                         Dance may be performed in religious or shamanic rituals, 
                         for example in rain dance performed in times of drought.
                        Dance is an important aspect of some religious rites in ancient Egypt,similarly dance is also integral to many ceremonies 
                        and rites among African people.Ritual dances may also be performed in temples and during religious festivals, 
                         for example the Rasa ritual dances of India (a number of Indian classical dances may have their origin in ritual dances).
